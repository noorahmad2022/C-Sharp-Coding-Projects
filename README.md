<b> Car Insurance Project </b>
<p>
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes users' input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.
</p>
</br>
<b>CRUD Operation</b>
<p>This is a basic employee information management system, which can store employees information. It is an .NET 6 Core MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a code first workflow. It is still a work in progress.</p>
