<b>Projects</b>

</ul>

<b> Car Insurance Project </b>
<p>
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes users' input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.

<b>NFL Stats</b>
<p>This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the purposes of fantasy football. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.</p>
